# Budgers - an arcade/puzzle game

Budgers is a Rust port of the arcade/puzzle game
[Budge](https://github.com/npryce/budge) by Nat Pryce.

It can be thought of as a cross between Sokoban, Pac-Man and Blind Date (the TV
show).

The object of the game is complete every level by getting the two monsters on
each level to bump into each other. One of the monsters wanders about
aimlessly, turning every time it bumps into anything. The other chases you
mercilessly, but stupidly. To help manoever the monsters together the levels
contain walls, gates, pushable discs and freeze-pills. However, certain objects
kill the player and some walls are invisible. Colliding with a monster is fatal
too.
